# Ships-in-Satellite-Imagery

## Context
In the field of computer vision and remote sensing, the automated classification and detection of objects in images taken by satellites has garnered significant interest because of their vast applications in maritime surveillance, environmental monitoring and security. In this domain a major challenge is the task of accurately detecting ships in the vast and dynamic maritime landscape captured in satellite images. The need to discern small, often indistinct objects within vast oceanic backgrounds, under varying lighting and weather conditions, accounts for the complexity of this task.


## Objective
I developed a deep-learning-based system using the Faster R-CNN model to classify ships in satellite imagery data. The dataset used for this project is a diverse dataset from Kaggle, Ships in Satellite Imagery. The proposed model aims for high accuracy and robust performance. Key deliverables for this project include a trained model, comprehensive evaluation metrics, contributing significantly to maritime surveillance and remote sensing.)
